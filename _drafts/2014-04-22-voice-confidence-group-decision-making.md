[Bayes' theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes'_theorem) in probability theory tells us that when we want to combine information from multiple sources (for example, different sensory modalities such as sight and touch) we should weigh them according to their reliability ([1](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v415/n6870/full/415429a.html),[2](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v427/n6971/full/nature02169.html)). That is, the more reliable source should have greater influence on our answer.

[Extending this thinking to group decision-making](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/329/5995/1081.short), Bayes' theorem prescribes that a collection of people trying to produce a single answer should weigh more the answers of those with the most reliable performance on the task. Of course, we don't always know how good people are at tasks, particularly when those people or tasks are new to us. An obvious proxy for the reliability of someone's answer is their confidence in that answer. Thus, Bayes' theorem suggests that for humans to excel at group decision-making, we should have evolved an efficient and accurate way of conveying confidence.

In a series of behavioral experiments on humans, I am trying to answer the following questions:

(1) What features of the human voice correlate with speaker confidence?<br>
(2) What features of the speaker's voice do listeners use to estimate their confidence?<br>
(3) If one alters the vocal features above, how does it affect group decision-making performance?<br>
(4) How do the answers to the above questions vary based on the cultures of and familiarity between the speaker and listener?

The idea for this project originates from a discussion with my master's thesis advisor, [Máté Lengyel](http://www3.eng.cam.ac.uk/~ml468/). A pilot version was carried out as a summer school project at [Cold Spring Harbor Asia](http://www.csh-asia.org/)'s 2013 [Computational and Cognitive Neuroscience Summer School (CCNSS)](http://www.csh-asia.org/s-cosyne13.html) with input from [Zach Mainen](http://neuro.fchampalimaud.org/en/research/group/Mainen/), [Eric DeWitt](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/eric-dewitt/0/3a9/214), and [Matt Botvinick](http://www.princeton.edu/~matthewb/). Now, a beefier version is underway at Princeton University in collaboration with [Angela Radulescu](http://www.angelaradulescu.com/), [Yael Niv](https://www.princeton.edu/~yael/), and [Matt Botvinick](http://www.princeton.edu/~matthewb/).
