<strong>WHAT'S THIS TRAVEL BLOG NONSENSE?</strong><br>
This summer, I will spending 2 months interning an international sales and marketing company as part of USC's Global Fellows Program. Transportation, housing, and food will be paid for by USC. I will blog about my experiences to preserve my experiences for posterity.

<strong>WHY WOULD USC DO THAT?? HAVE THEY MET HIM??</strong><br>
Calm down. I am minimally qualified. I may not be a business major, but I've been to Hong Kong on an international business trip, I speak decent Chinese, I've spent the last 2 years running sales and marketing for college travel agency EF College Break at USC, and I interned for an international software startup last year. I've also never been arrested in another a country, harbor no known contagious diseases, and can do at least 75 push ups.

<strong>DO I HAVE TO READ THIS CRAP?</strong><br>
No, not at all. You are free to completely ignore my email updates or you can email me to get off (or heck, on) the list. The initial people on this update list were gleamed from my contacts based on who I judged might be interested in updates from the Orient (I promise to stop saying 'Orient' once I get there).

<strong>CAN I COME OVER AND LOOK AT YOUR PICTURES WHEN YOU GET BACK??</strong><br>
No. I'm going to India.
