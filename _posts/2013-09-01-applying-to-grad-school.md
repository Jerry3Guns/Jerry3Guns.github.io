I gave an info session at McGill in March 2013 on applying to graduate schools in Canada, the U.S., and Britain. Here are some things I found most useful and what I wish I had known:

* What is grad school? [Matt Might](http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/) might have the answer.
* Decide where to apply: talk to professors at your school in the fields you are interested in and ask them what schools do the best research in those fields. If you have multiple interests or haven't decided what you want to study, pick schools with research groups in a variety of fields.
* Deadlines: write down every deadline of every school and fellowship you are considering. If you are applying to start in September, there will be deadlines as early as September the previous year, meaning you should aim to get those applications *finished* in August of the previous year. It is never too early to write down the deadlines of every school and fellowship you are applying for (e.g. the Rhodes, NSERC PGS, and Vanier deadlines are in September; Oxford's first deadline is in October).
* Requirements: figure out what you need to submit to the school to apply (viz. navigate the mazes of academic websites). A typical application consists of three letters of recommendation, a two-page statement of purpose (essay), CV, an application fee, and test scores (GRE, subject GRE, and TOEFL).
* Apply to as many schools as you can - once you have one application done, additional applications don't take much time. People typically apply to around ten schools (a few top schools, a few in the middle, and a few 'safeties' where admission is anticipated). 
* Do not worry about the cost of tests and applications - most programs will pay you a decent salary and you will readily make back what you spent (if you gain admission to just one program).
* Apply to every scholarship and fellowship you are eligible for which will support your graduate studies. It is good practice writing the research statements and essays and you may even be successful.

#The Application

Your application will be reviewed by a committee typically consisting of faculty members (and sometimes senior graduate students). As the majority of your graduate school will consist of doing research, the most important you can do in your application is to demonstrate research ability. The best way to do this is to do summer research and work hard in the hopes of getting published and getting good recommendation letters attesting to your potential for doing research. The next best way is to take research-based courses at your school. Grades are not a good measure of how good someone will be at doing research, so if you have to sacrifice grades a little in order to do research, do so.

Therefore, start doing research as early as possible. If you are a high school student, send me an [email](mailto:altosaar@princeton.edu) and I will gladly tell you how to start working in a lab in high school. If you are in college:

* Start talking to potential summer research supervisors in November of the previous year (in January of the same year at the latest). You can also apply to work at different schools - it is a bit harder, but the same process applies. Look up professors you are interested in working with, and send them a short email with your LaTeXed CV (see below) asking about doing a summer project and which area of their research appeals to you. It helps to have read or at least skimmed their latest publications so you can mention these in your email as well (usually their website is not current so you can look up their latest papers on PubMed, the arXiv, or the ISI Web of Knowledge)
Apply for an REU if you are a US citizen, or an NSERC USRA if you are Canadian or to the Caltech SURF program if you are either or neither. The DAAD RISE program has internships opportunities in Germany
Jan Gorzny at UToronto has a helpful page on the NSERC USRA.
Apply for every summer research scholarship such as the REU, DAAD RISE, Caltech SURF, or NSERC USRA even if you do not have the most competitive application and transcript, as the professor you apply with may decide to fund you through a separate grant if your initial funding application is not successful
You may have to contact many professors before you find one willing to take you on - this is normal (each year I contacted around 30 faculty in order to have a few options)
Take research courses, as electives or for your degree. For these you will also have to seek out professors to work with. At McGill such courses are the 396 research courses, and other possible routes are MATH 470 (Honours Research Project) or PHYS 459 (Honours Research Project or Thesis)
Before contacting professors, read Matt Might's how to email, use your official school email address, and Boomerang your emails to arrive at 9 AM on Wednesdays.
If you cannot find a professor willing to take you on for the summer, consider volunteering in a lab for a few hours each week or take a research course to get your foot in the door. If you have LaTeXed your CV (see below) tried the above options, contacted a ton of professors, and have been unsuccessful in securing a summer or semester-long position, send me an email and I will do my best to tell you how to improve your application.
Persistence pays off with professors - if they don't reply initially, show up at their office or send a follow up email. You can also attend local colloquia or talks in fields that interest you; approach professors after their talk to ask about opportunities at their school, get their card or contact info, and follow up via email.
Once you're working in research, do your best to see your project through from start to finish (this may mean putting in extra, un-paid time). This is important!
