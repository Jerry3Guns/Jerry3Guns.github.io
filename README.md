This Jekyll theme powers my personal website.

This is forked from [**Cole Townsend**](http://coletownsend.com)'s [**Balzac**](https://github.com/ColeTownsend/Balzac-for-Jekyll) theme with heavy inspiration from his website. Some improvements were introduced thanks to [**Michael Rose**](http://mademistakes.com)'s [**So Simple**](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme) theme for Jekyll (such as Bing Verification, Google Analytics, Authorship, and Webmaster Tools support).

Setup and settings are similar to [**Balzac**](https://github.com/ColeTownsend/Balzac-for-Jekyll)'s. Please file an issue if something is not clear or you have any questions.
