I entertained ideas of becoming a filmmaker, sherpa, and professional chef before turning to science. My first loves and weapons of choice are physics and mathematics, but I now apply them to try to understand biological systems as solutions to computational problems. My scientific mecca is to understand the human brain well enough to improve upon it. When I’m not thinking about biology and computation, I’m usually thinking about how to improve science and education using the web. And when I’m not thinking at all, I often make mistakes.

I studied physics and math at the University of Southern California, spent a year at the University of Cambridge’s Computational and Biological Learning Laboratory on a Churchill Scholarship, and am now a PhD student in physics at Princeton University on a Hertz Fellowship and DoE Computational Sciences Graduate Fellowship. I work with Bill Bialek and Carlos Brody.
