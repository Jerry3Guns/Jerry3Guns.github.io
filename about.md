I entertained ideas of becoming a filmmaker, sherpa, and professional chef before turning to science. My first loves and weapons of choice are physics and mathematics, but I now apply them to try to understand biological systems. My scientific mecca is to understand the human brain well enough to improve upon it. When I’m not thinking about biology and computation, I’m usually thinking about how to improve science and education using the web. And when I’m not thinking at all, I often make mistakes.

My research focuses on trying to understand the design principles of biological systems. In particular, I try to understand organisms as solutions to the computational problems that they face. We do this by (1) guessing the function of a biological system, (2) formalizing this as the objective function (and constraints) for a mathematical optimization problem, (3) solving the optimization problem, and (4) comparing the optimized result with the observed system. If they match, it suggests that we have correctly identified the function of the system. By doing so, my and related research tries to provide “why” answers in a field traditionally focused on the “what” and “how.” In addition, this type of approach often leads to the fascinating realization that many biological systems approach optimality, that is the limits set by basic physical or statistical limits. In all cases, this approach necessitates a tight coupling between experimental and theoretical work and, on the theory side, liberal borrowing of tools from other fields, including statistical physics, information theory, machine learning, and dynamical systems.

I studied physics and math at the [University of Southern California](http://www.usc.edu/), spent a year at the [University of Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk/)’s [Computational and Biological Learning Laboratory](http://learning.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/) on a [Churchill Scholarship](http://www.winstonchurchillfoundation.org/), and am now a PhD student in physics at [Princeton University](http://www.princeton.edu/) on a [Hertz Fellowship](http://www.hertzfoundation.org) and [DoE Computational Sciences Graduate Fellowship](http://www.krellinst.org/csgf/). My primary advisor is [Bill Bialek](http://www.princeton.edu/~wbialek/wbialek.html), though I also work/frequently interact with [Yael Niv](https://www.princeton.edu/~yael/), [Matt Botvinick](http://www.princeton.edu/~matthewb/), and [Jonathan Pillow](https://pni.princeton.edu/faculty/jonathan-pillow) at Princeton, as well as Northwestern's [David Schwab](http://www.physics.northwestern.edu/people/personalpages/DavidSchwab.html), UChicago's [Stephanie Palmer](http://pondside.uchicago.edu/oba/faculty/palmer_s.html), and USC's [Bartlett Mel](http://ngp.usc.edu/faculty/profile/?fid=12).

I'm a bit of a [travel junkie](https://www.tripit.com/people/djstrouse) and have lived for a month or more in: [Cambridge, England](http://djstrouse.com/dispatch-from-england-part-i-life-at-churchill-college/); [Shanghai, China](http://djstrouse.com/preparing-for-china-the-situation/); [Torino, Italy](http://djstrouse.com/benvenuto-a-torino-a-day-in-the-life-of-a-mountain-dwelling-physicist/); [Budapest, Hungary](http://cognitivescience.ceu.hu/); [Będlewo, Poland](http://www.neuroinf.pl/Members/danek/accn/accn2012/accn); [Waterloo, Ontario, Canada](https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/); and Seoul, South Korea (and traveled to another 20 or so countries beyond that). Within the US, I've lived a month or more in: Chicago, IL (born); Newark, DE (raised); [Los Angeles, CA](http://www.usc.edu/); [Princeton, NJ](http://www.princeton.edu); [Woods Hole, MA](http://www.mbl.edu/mcn/); [Palo Alto, CA](http://ssrp.stanford.edu/), and [Berkeley, CA](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/doe-lab-practicum/abstracts?f=berkeley).
